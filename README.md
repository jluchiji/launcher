#Launcher
An attempt to recreate the **[Google's Chrome App Launcher](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/launcher)** in C#/WPF. It is not compatible with Mono at the moment due to some Win32 calls.

##License
The software is still work in progress, and therefore its license has not been decided yet.
Most likely I will release it under the MIT License, unless some components of the software require me to use another license such GNU GPL or MS-PL. The bottom line is that the software will be open source.
